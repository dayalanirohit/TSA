PROBLEM STATEMENT-
The objective of this assignment is to predict the hourly averaged concentrations of various air pollutants for the next 48 hours using the provided dataset and  validate the predictions using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) over the last 10 percent
of the data, to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

DATA DESCRIPTION-
The dataset consists of 9358 instances, each representing hourly averaged responses from
various chemical sensors. Ground truth hourly averaged concentrations for various pollutants
including CO, Non-Metanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC), Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Missing
values are tagged with -200.

Attribute information:
0. Date (DD/MM/YYYY)
1. Time (HH.MM.SS)
2. True hourly averaged concentration CO in mg/m^3 (reference analyzer)
3. PT08.S1 (tin oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally CO targeted)
4. True hourly averaged overall Non Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in microg/m^3
(reference analyzer)
5. True hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)
6. PT08.S2 (titania) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NMHC targeted)
7. True hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb (reference analyzer)
8. PT08.S3 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NOx targeted)
9. True hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer)
10. PT08.S4 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NO2 targeted)
11. PT08.S5 (indium oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally O3 targeted)
12. Temperature in Â°C
13. Relative Humidity (%)
14. Absolute Humidity (AH)

I 've use ARIMA model to predcict the hourly averaged concentrations of air pollutants .
